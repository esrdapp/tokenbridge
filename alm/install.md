1. ensure the contracts have already been compiled. There will be a "build" folder full of json files if it has been compiled. 
If not you will need to run "npm run compile" in tokenbridge/contracts folder
2. switch node to version 14 to avoid a yarn error with /tokenbridge/commons/message.js: 
nvm install 14 
nvm use 14
3. yarn start
